# Messenger within one computer - multiple clients (threads) and server in Swing

First compile. Then:

1. You have to run Server on one terminal. To do that, type in:
    
    ```
    java Server
    ```
    
    - Server is running...

2. Start few client threads, each on other terminal, by typing:

    ```
    java Client id_number
    ```
    
    - for example: 

    ```
    java Client 10
    ```
    
3. Now you can chat with other clients.
